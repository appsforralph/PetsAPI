# ASP.NET Core WebApi DogCat API

This .NET Core API is an exercise for showcasing the ability in developing a REST API and integrating 3rd
party services. The two 3rd party involve are https://thedogapi.com/ and https://thecatapi.com/.
This repository contains a controller which is dealing with the combination of Dog and Cat API. All of the methods used are in GET.

Hope this helps.
